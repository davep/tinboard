# TinBoard

![TinBoard](./tinboard.png)

A very early work in progress. This will be turning into a full
terminal-based Pinboard client. At the moment this is a read-only client;
something to let me riff on the interface and decide what I like. Once that
has settled down I'll be adding full write capability too.

All application data lives in `~/.local/share/tinboard`; if you want to wipe
it out just nuke that directory.

As for bugs and feature requests and stuff... not yet thanks; that time will
come. :-)

Things to do:

- [ ] Full text search.

      bookmark.
