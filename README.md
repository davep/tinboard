## Introduction

Tinboard is a terminal-based client application for the [Pinboard
bookmarking service](https://pinboard.in/about/). It provides the ability to
manage and search your bookmarks in the terminal.

## Installing

### pipx

The package can be installed using [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):

```sh
$ pipx install tinboard
```

Once installed run the `tinboard` command.

### Homebrew

The package is available via Homebrew. Use the following commands to install:

```sh
$ brew tap davep/homebrew
$ brew install tinboard
```

Once installed run the `tinboard` command.

## Getting started

To use Tinboard you will need a Pinboard account (this application isn't
going to be useful to anyone who isn't a Pinboard user). Assuming you *do*
have a Pinboard account, you can get going by running up `tinboard` and
providing your API token when asked:

![The Tinboard token input dialog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davep/tinboard/main/images/token-request.png)

If you're not sure where to find your API token, just press <kbd>F1</kbd>,
or the `Go to token` button, and you'll be taken to the relevant Pinboard
page in your browser; copy the token, come back to this dialog and paste it
in.

Once done Tinboard will download your bookmarks and you're good to go!

*NOTE: if it's your preference, you can set the token in an environment
variable called `TINBOARD_API_TOKEN`.*

## Using Tinboard

The best way to get to know Tinboard is to read the help screen, once in the
main application you can see this by pressing <kbd>F1</kbd>.

## TODO

Things I'm considering adding or addressing:

- [ ] Double-check the rate limits on the API calls to be sure they're correct.
- [ ] A bookmark export facility.
- [ ] A bookmark availability checker.
  - [ ] Check the current bookmark.
  - [ ] A mode that slowly checks all bookmarks.
- [ ] Support for Pinboard Notes.
- [X] Optionally sort the tags by count.
