# TinBoard

A very early work in progress. This will be turning into a full
terminal-based Pinboard client. This very first (very alpha) release is a
read-only client; something to let me riff on the interface and decide what
I like.

All application data lives in `~/.local/share/tinboard`; if you want to wipe
it out just nuke that directory.

As for bugs and feature requests and stuff... not yet thanks; that time will
come. :-)
